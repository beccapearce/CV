I'm a former teacher who studied Linguistics at UCL. Within my degree, my passion for learning quirks of logic in language and problem solving led me to discover my interest in learning how to code. To pursue this, I attended Makers Academy, Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp. During this time, I've learned the importance of writing clean code, asking the right questions and how to thrive on the edge of known technologies and unknown realms of possibilty.

I am looking for a back-end developer role which provides opportunities to learn and grow with a team that constantly looks forward at new developments in technology.

#### Mentoring

I believe that teaching is one of the best ways you can learn.

I have always incorporated some form of mentoring into my role. During university I was a mentor for 9 fresher students. This led me to volunteering as a Latin teacher and then taking a job in that same company after a year. I then continued this guiding role at makers by having two mentees and aiding them in their coding journey.

#### Learning

Learning is a driving force in my coding projects.

I love to learn new information, especially discovering idiomatic features of languages both natural and in coding. I have demonstrated this multiple times: through my degree which was an exercise in constant problem solving, the intensive nature of the Makers Academy course, and finally through learning a new language (Elixir) within 3 days and going on to produce Quizzbuzz as a final project piece at the end of the makers course.

#### Team work

Working in a team brings out the best in all members.

Working in a team I have come to see is the best way to code, within makers academy I have worked with pairs from the start and then progressed to working in teams of 4 to 5. During our final project we maintained great communication within the team despite working of different sections of the project enabling us to have a full in-depth understanding of how the whole code base worked not just our own individual tasks.

A 16-week web development bootcamp which puts emphasis on:
- Pair programming
- Test driven development and behaviour driven development
- Agile methodologies
- Object-oriented design
- How to learn and apply knowledge in a pressured environment and a short space of time

#### University College London (Sep 2011 to June 2015)

- Linguistics, BA Hons 2:1

Linguistics is the study of language, its processing in the brain, the sounds that form it, how it's put together and how meaning is conveyed. I did this course with an international year spent at Ca Foscari, University of Venice.

I'm a software developer specialising in Ruby.

After attending a pitch deck by dotforge (a tech for good incubator) I decided to put my affinity for logic and problem solving towards coding. I was really impressed by the positive impact coding can have on people and how it can amplify the efforts of one person. As a path into this realm I attended [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp.

I am now looking for a back-end focused role which provides opportunities to learn and make something amazing.

#### Ruby

Ruby is the language I have used (and love) the most. I can use both rails and sinatra and use a TDD approach and Object-oriented design.


#### Mentoring

I believe that teaching is one of the best ways you can learn.

I have always incorporated some form of mentoring into my role. During university I was a mentor for 9 new students. This led me to volunteering as a Latin teacher and then taking a job in that same charity after a year. I then continued this guiding role at Makers Academy by having two mentees and aiding them in their coding journey.

#### Learning

Learning is a driving force in my coding projects.

I love to learn new information, especially discovering idiomatic features of languages both natural and in coding. I have demonstrated this multiple times: through my degree which was an exercise in constant problem solving, the intensive nature of the Makers Academy course, and finally through learning a new language and framework (Elixir with Phoenix) within 3 days and going on to produce [Quizzbuzz](https://github.com/quizzbuzz/quizzbuzz) as a final project piece at the end of the Makers Academy course in the week that followed.

#### Team work

Working in a team brings out the best in all members.

Working in a team I have come to see is the best way to code, within Makers Academy I have worked with pairs from the start and then progressed to working in teams of 4 to 5. During our final project we maintained great communication within the team despite working on different sections of the project, enabling us to have a full in-depth understanding of how the whole code base worked not just our own individual tasks.

#### Makers Academy (July 2016 to September 2016)

A 16-week web development bootcamp which puts emphasis on:
- Pair programming
- Test driven development and behaviour driven development
- Agile methodologies
- Object-oriented design
- How to learn and apply knowledge in a pressured environment and a short space of time

#### University College London (Sep 2011 to June 2015)

- Linguistics with International year

Linguistics is the study of language, its processing in the brain, the sounds that form it and how it's put together. I did this course with an international year spent living in Venice.
